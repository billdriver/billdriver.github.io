I've tried over the years to actively blog about my career as an IT professional. I'm always pumped up for a few weeks to get the blog rolling with a lot of ideas, but ultimately I forget it after a few weeks. 

This year; 2015, I'm going to try again. I'm going to try and become a halfway decent IT professional blogger. I've got a few subjects up my sleeve and hope to blog 2-3 times a week. Looking at topics such as network administration, the datacenter, virtualization, and other topics I encounter on a daily basis being an IT professional. Maybe, even throw in a few blogs about living the life of an IT professional and gadgets. 

The focus isn't changing. I'm still sold on being an IT professional with a blog, but this year will be different than the last. I'm focusing on keeping it simple. 

I used to think that blog posts needed to be essays and made of many many words, but what I realized is that keeping it short and simple is the way to go. It keeps readers interested than a boring 5000 word essay the is repetitive. 

Anyways, here we go...again.
