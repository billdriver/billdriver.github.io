Here we are, it's Sunday morning and I'm starting to prepare for the work week; I'm calculating time sheets for my staff and getting ready to load a software upgrade into the test environment. I often find myself doing this as a way to get ahead before the rush of the work week. I make it a purpose of mine to stay ahead, never fall behind; even if that means giving up a few hour of my weekend to answer emails, install a patch, or work a few trouble tickets. I don't think there is anything better than starting Monday with a clean slate. 

There is several reasons I push myself to stay ahead.  First, when something goes wrong and consumes my time; I don't want my other responsibilities and projects to suffer because I'm behind due to an unplanned downtime or major issue. It's the inevitable in IT, something is going to hit the fan and consume your day, your week. It happens to every one in their career. Staying ahead in other daily responsibilities and projects, makes the impact of a major event more tolerable and less stressful knowing you will have very little to catch up on after the major event passes. 

Next, I don't want to be the guy that everyone is waiting on to finish their work. It's not going to be on my shoulders that a project gets delayed. I'm not going to be the one being talked about in executive level meetings because their portion of the job hasn't been completed. Staying ahead goes a long way to project a positive image to those you are working with that you are going to get your job done correctly without delay. 

Another equally important reason I do anything I can to stay ahead is that it allows me more opportunity to further my job skills, document what I know, learn something new, or just prepare/plan for the future. By taking care of everything on your plate and staying ahead means that you can focus in other areas that not only benefit yourself, but also benefit the organization you are working for. Maybe it's learning Powershell scripting, maybe it's optimizing DNS servers, maybe it's just documentation of a new process. 

As a result of pushing myself to stay ahead, it let's me relax. There is not a need to worry about the emails piling up because I know I'll only have a handful to respond to if I step away for a few hours. If someone approaches me with a new project, I know I can get to it quickly because all of my other projects are where those projects should be. 

I'm going to close with this quote from NFL Legend, Jerry Rice. 

>Today I will do what others won't, so tomorrow I can accomplish what others can't.
