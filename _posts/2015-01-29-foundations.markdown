In one of my first blog posts, I listed my goals out for the year; one of which was to become proficient at Powershell. I work with some awesome guys that can do some amazing things with Powershell that can cut 2 day long tasks into 30 minutes of scripting, which is why I have a keen interest in Powershell. So, I began working through a book I picked up last year, "Powershell in a Month of Lunches" by Don Jones and Jeffrey Hicks. It started out with learning how to customize Poweshell, how to search for commands, then understanding command syntax, then moved into piping commands together, and looking at starting objects. The point in me mention this is to show how important building the foundation is, starting from the basis, understanding the core principles of the subject at hand. 

Sure, I could have jumped right in and started reviewing complex code and decyphering piece by piece to understand the code, but at the end of the day that's going to leave me confused and potentially teach me bad habits depending the code I am reviewing. However, I opted to start from the beginning. I know some Poweshell, I've used commands, I've wrote some scripts; but I felt to fully understand and to get to where I want to be, I needed to start from the beginning and build that foundation. 

Foundations are key to learning, without foundations learning becomes difficult. It's imperative to learn the core of subject before jumping into complex usage. Don't feel bad if you have to review the foundational material several times. If you can grasp the basis of the subject being learned, it makes learning the advanced material much easier.
